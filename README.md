# Hackers Poulette Network Design

## What
This project is a Cisco Packet Tracer simulation (.pka file) for designing a scalable and secure network for the Hackers Poulette startup. It connects three hosts to the internet, with plans for future expansion as the startup grows.

## Why
Hackers Poulette needs a secure, flexible, and scalable network that allows for future growth. This network will serve as the foundation for their office setup, ensuring stable connections and easy upgrades.

## When
This project is an ongoing effort, with future updates expected as the network evolves. Currently, it supports three hosts but is designed for scalability.

## How
- The network is designed using Cisco Packet Tracer.
- It includes:
  - A switch (Cisco 2960)
  - Three PCs connected via Ethernet
  - IP addressing for seamless communication between hosts and internet connectivity
- Future upgrades may include additional switches, routers, and security measures.

## Who
- **Designed by**: [Saba]
- **For**: Hackers Poulette, led by CEO Robert Tappan Morris
- **Contact**: [becode.org]

## Pending Things to Do
- Expand the network to include additional hosts and switches.
- Add VLAN segmentation for enhanced security.
- Implement RADIUS or ACL-based security for access control.
- Set up a DHCP server to streamline IP address management.
- Establish firewall protection for the network perimeter.
